### UX

This website project will target a large demographic of individuals and families from all walks of life, hence an overall simple, yet effective website is aimed at. The priority focus is on information, maps, subscribing to a mailing list, contact and social media links.

---

#### 1. Strategy

> The UX is clean and user-friendly and provides an easy navigation journey to reach relevant sections with ease.
>
> ##### Project Goals:
>
> - Showcase the top 3 game reserves in 4 of Southern Africa's most well-renowned Safari destination countries.
> - Promoting game reserves by showcasing the best they have to offer.
> - Obtaining subscriptions for mailing list, thereby increasing customer databases.
> - Direction to Facebook Group links for each reserve, expanding on their group numbers.
>
> ##### Customer Goals:
>
> - Designed site with Mobile-first approach.
> - Display interactive maps for each country and each reserve within each country
> - Contact form provided with option to sign up for mailing list.
> - Relevant Social Media icons in the footer and links in reserve pages.
> - Fixed navigation bar providing user easy navigation reference.
> - Review API (Stretch goal)

#### 2. Scope

> - Provides a clean UX for users with easy navigation.
> - Fits in with my current skill-set of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and API use.
> - Quickly defines the content and focus on images and maps, subscribing to a mailing list and getting in touch via email or social media.
> - I've included some JavaScript animations to subtly enhance the overall experience without overpowering the page.

#### 3. Structure

> The main focus of the structure is to allow Users to quickly assimilate the information, maps and imagery.
> Short, focused paragraphs of content information to provide enough information, yet not overwhelm.
> A selection of quality images to showcase the game reserves.
> Points of contact are provided via email contact form (with newsletter subscription option) and links to Social Media in Footer.

#### 4. Skeleton

> - [Wireframes](assets/docs/wireframes.pdf): One-page website with **4** main sections.
> - Fixed navigation bar - Menu headings pointing to each of the 4 pages.
> - Home, About, Reserves and Contact pages
> - Footer with Copyright info and Social Media icons
> - (Add Country info via API - stretch goal dependent on time) - Stretch goal completed - Country REST API Info presented on About section.
> - (Review API section - stretch goal)

---

#### 5. Surface

> ###### Colours
>
> Nature/Safari colours to fit in with the theme of wildlife conservation
>
> ![Image](assets/img/palette.png)
>
> ###### Typography
>
> - "Crete Round" font (with fall-back font of Serif) for main headings. This font was chosen for its typical 'Safari' look.
> - "ABeeZee" font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif) for body content which I found clean and balanced and not too formal.
>
> ###### Images
>
> The image selection has been carefully considered to best showcase each reserve.
>
> ###### Maps
>
> Interactive maps with smooth transitions to each location
> Additional reserve info on map markers

### Testing

> Testing documentation can be found on a separate document [HERE](assets/docs/Testing.md)

### Project barriers and solutions

> - Map pins were not removing after clicking reserve button, and then clicking a new country button. Had a screen-share session with Tim Nelson to try and resolve this. Need to research using Marker Clusters with LeafetJS - Updated: Tim found a fix for the existing code without necessitating marker clusters.
> - Existing layout for Country/Reserve section with maps was not as expected on mobile view as the UX was difficult to navigate. Overcame this by creating a new branch and testing a new layout using dropdown buttons for the main country and reserve buttons.
> - As above, found that when selecting a reserve (and then trying to scroll down to the info (under the map) it was finicky on mobile as the map is touch-responsive. This was interfering with usability and UX. Simply moved the map under the reserve info, which resolved the issue along with the dropdown box layout.
> - Was having issues with the live webcam player for Namibia, (for which the only available source is non-Youtube based). Replaced with live-stream from a South African waterhole for this section (to be looked and and try to resolve after project submission).
> - Had an issue with slideshow images all showing for 1 second before loading first image. After not finding a resolution and trying various functions, I overcame this by designing a pre-loading animation. This not only resolved the issue, but added a good intro and UX to the site.

### Code validity

---

### Version Control

> - Used Git for version control.
> - Branches were created to work on alternative layout and buttons.
> - The branches were then merged with the master branch after any conflicts were addressed.

---

### Deployment

This project has been deployed on GitHub Pages with the following process:

> - All code was written on VSCode, a local IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
> - The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my [Repository](https://github.com/JimLynx/CI-MS2-Safari-Africa).
> - Under the Settings section of the GitHub repository, scrolled down to GitHub Pages section.
> - Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.
> - Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site URL.
> - There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.
> - The code can be run locally through clone or download.
> - You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.
> - The Clone option provides a URL, which you can use on your desktop IDE.
> - The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine.
