### UX

This website project will target a large demographic of individuals and families from all walks of life, hence an overall simple, yet effective website is aimed at. The priority focus is on information, maps, subscribing to a mailing list, contact and social media links.

---

#### 1. Strategy

> The UX is clean and user-friendly and provides an easy navigation journey to reach relevant sections with ease.
>
> ##### Project Goals:
>
> - Showcase the top 3 game reserves in 4 of Southern Africa's most well-renowned Safari destination countries.
> - Promoting game reserves by showcasing the best they have to offer.

>
> ##### Customer Goals:

#### 2. Scope

> - Provides a clean UX for users with easy navigation.
> - Fits in with my current skill-set of HTML, CSS, Javascript and API use.
> - Quickly defines the content and focus on getting in touch via email or social media.
> - I've included some Javascript animations to subtly enhance the overall experience without overpowering the page.

#### 3. Structure

> The main focus of the structure is to allow Users to quickly assimilate the information and imagery.
> Short, focused paragraphs of content information to provide enough information, yet not overwhelm.
> A selection of quality images to showcase the game reserves.
> Points of contact are provided via email contact form and links to Social Media in Footer.

#### 4. Skeleton

> - [Wireframes](assets/docs/wireframes.pdf): One-page website with **4** main sections.
> - Game reserves navigation dropdown to 4 additional sections, 1 for each reserve.
> - Home, About, Volunteer (with 3 sub-menu items) , Contact and Donate pages
> - Fixed navigation bar - Menu headings pointing to each of the 4 pages.
> - Footer with Copyright info and Social Media icons
> - (Review API section - stretch goal)

#### 5. Surface

I've decided on 'nature/safari' colours to fit in with the theme of wildlife conservation.

> ###### Colours
>
> Nature/safari' colours to fit in with the theme of wildlife conservation
>
> - Insert Colour palette
>
> ###### Typography
>
> - "Crete Round" font (with fall-back font of Serif) for main headings. This font was chosen for its typical 'Safari' look.
> - "ABeeZee" font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif) for body content which I found clean and balanced and not too formal.
>
> ###### Images
>
> The image selection has been carefully considered to best showcase each reserve.

### Deployment

This project has been deployed on GitHub Pages with the following process:

> - All code was written on Gitpod, an online IDE.
> - The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my [Repository](https://github.com/JimLynx/CI-MS1-Explore-Ireland).
> - Under the [settings](https://github.com/JimLynx/CI-MS1-Explore-Ireland/settings) section of the GitHub repository, scrolled down to GitHub Pages section.
> - Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.
> - Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site url.
> - There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.
> - The code can be run locally through clone or download.
> - You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.
> - The Clone option provides a url, which you can use on your desktop IDE.
> - The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine.
